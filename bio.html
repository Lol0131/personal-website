        <h2>Biography</h2>
         <p>
            I’m a first generation college student, born in <strong>Paraguay</strong> and raised in New York after immigrating to the United States at the age of seven. 
            I’m currently pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science with a minor in Cybersecurity at Florida Atlantic University. 
            Cybersecurity is one of my strong interests, especially in areas like <strong>penetration testing</strong>, system assurance, and other sectors focused on identifying vulnerabilities and strengthening digital infrastructure. 
        
            During my freshman year, I interned with the <strong>U.S. House of Representatives</strong>, where I gained early exposure to public service, professional communication, and the importance of civic responsibility. 
            For the past two years, I’ve worked with <strong>CLEAR</strong> across Miami and New York City, supporting operations at airports, stadiums, and arenas. 
            I currently serve as an <strong>Ambassador at the airport</strong> and a <strong>Lead Ambassador at arena and stadium events</strong>, where I help manage team flow, train new ambassadors, and ensure a secure and efficient experience for thousands of guests. 
        
            At FAU, I’ve taken on leadership roles within the <strong>Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE)</strong>. 
            I recently served as <strong>Co-Chair of SHPEtinas</strong>, a role focused on uplifting and empowering Latina women in STEM. 
            Through that position, I led events, partnered with guest speakers, and created a space for mentorship, visibility, and encouragement. 
        
            Alongside academics and leadership, I’ve built websites and completed cybersecurity labs that deepened my understanding of how systems work  
            from navigating the terminal and managing programs, to working with tools like <strong>John the Ripper</strong> to analyze password vulnerabilities and compare brute-force methods to strategic attacks. 
        
            With a diverse background and a practical, people-first mindset, I’m motivated to keep growing and contributing to meaningful, inclusive work. 
            My story as an immigrant, student, and aspiring tech professional reminds me daily that resilience and purpose are at the heart of everything I pursue.
